Learning SLAM! 

### Fundamental Math
* *3D Rigid Body Motion:* rotation matrices, euler angles, quaternions, gimbal lock, homogenous coordinates, Rodriguez
* *Lie Group and Lie Algebra:* SO(3), SE(3), exponential map, logarithmic map   

## Status
Mar 23: running into too many porting issues on macOS for the code samples. Will revisit slambook this summer,  once I am able to dual boot Linux. Back to the basics for now.
